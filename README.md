The Airgead Banking Investment Calculator is a C++ application developed to help users understand the power of compound interest in investments. This project solves the problem of visualizing how investments grow over time, both with and without regular monthly deposits. Users can input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit value, annual interest rate, and investment period in years. The program then calculates and displays year-end balances and earned interest in well-formatted tables, allowing users to make informed financial decisions.

In this project, I effectively implemented object-oriented programming principles through a clean class structure that separates concerns and promotes code organization. The InvestmentCalculator class encapsulates all the necessary functionality while hiding implementation details. I'm particularly proud of the formatted output display which presents financial data in a clear, professional manner using proper alignment and currency formatting. Additionally, I maintained consistent adherence to the Airgead Banking coding standards throughout the implementation, including appropriate naming conventions and code structure.

Several enhancements could make this code more robust and user-friendly: implementing more thorough input validation, including handling non-numeric inputs; adding the ability to save results to a file for future reference; creating a more sophisticated user interface, perhaps with graphical elements to visualize the growth; implementing additional financial calculation options (e.g., different compounding periods, variable interest rates); and adding unit tests to ensure calculation accuracy across different input scenarios. These improvements would make the code more resilient to unexpected user inputs and provide a more comprehensive financial planning tool.

The most challenging aspect of this project was implementing the compound interest calculations correctly, particularly for the monthly deposits scenario. I had to carefully think through the logic of how interest compounds over time while accounting for regular deposits. To overcome this challenge, I broke down the problem into smaller steps and verified my calculations against known examples. I also utilized online compound interest calculators to cross-check my results and ensure accuracy. This process taught me the importance of testing with multiple data sets and approaching complex calculations methodically.

This project has strengthened several skills that will transfer to future work: object-oriented design principles and class structure development; financial algorithm implementation and mathematical precision; proper code documentation and adherence to industry coding standards; user interface design considerations, even in a console application; and input validation and error handling techniques. These skills are fundamental to software development across various domains and will be valuable in future programming projects regardless of the specific language or application type.

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable through several practices: consistent and meaningful variable/method naming (using prefixes like m_ for member variables); comprehensive comments explaining the purpose of classes, methods, and complex calculations; proper separation of concerns with header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files; use of appropriate data structures (vectors to store yearly results); clear formatting and consistent indentation throughout the codebase; encapsulation of functionality within a well-designed class that could be easily extended; and exception handling to gracefully manage errors. These practices ensure that the code can be understood, maintained, and extended by other developers, including my future self when revisiting this project.
